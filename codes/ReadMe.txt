This zip file contains python files:
	- data_loading.py (Functions that are used for loading data from the github and google drive)
	- Model_Functions.py (Functions that are used for training and testing the models)
	- Models.py (Models classes for the models mentioned in the report. ConvNet is used for RGB and Basline)
	- pre_process.py (Functions that are used for preprocessing the audio data)
	
it also contains a jet colourmap from matlab, that is used for RGB decomposition.

Additionally, there are 6 notebooks:
	- (Model Name)_Training_Testing (These are notebooks that contain the code needed to load both the clean and noisy data, along with traing and test the model)

note that the google drive from the report must be mounted prior to training and testing the noisy data. Instructions for this can be found on the github also found in the report on the title page footnotes.
